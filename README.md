./kissdownloader [--series/-s or --episode/-e] [link] [episodes-numbers-if-link-is-a-series] [-n season-for-episode-if-series] [-q/--quality quality] ...
You can provide as many links as is technically possible ;) On giving a series, you must follow with at least one episode number.
Note: You can supply -s [num] as an argument to indicate the particular season the following episodes will be in.
If no season is supplied and is needed, it will be asked for.
